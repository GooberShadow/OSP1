THIS IS BENJAMIN KEHE's README FILE
I logged different parts of my code through git and github. Partway through I tried making a branch and I worked in that branch from there on out. I got the depth-first indentation working but I could not get a default to work for indenting. So you must use -I n to specify how much you want to indent for each level. Along with this, one must also specify a directory name when executing the program. It will not default to the current directory unfortunately. For example, I tested my program by executing this command: ./dt -I 4 .    I hope that these 2 problems will not cause too much of an issue as I completed the rest of the project and I am proud of the work. When compiling, use make to compile and ./dt to execute the program. When it compiles it throws a warning and a note. These do not have any effect on this program so do not worry about them.
